# SocialMediaAnalysis
 
## Functionalities
There seems to be a great correlation between the popularity of a certain token on twitter (and other social media) and its price. This simple command line tool allows to investigate those patterns by facilitating the downloading and visualization of twitter metrics and the corresponding price of the token. The queries can be performed on the account of the token or more broadly on a specific keyword. Downloads from twitter have been parallelized for higher speed, the data is stored and is easily visualizable with the plot commands.
